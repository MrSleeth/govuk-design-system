## Help improve this page
To help make sure that this page is useful, relevant and up to date, you can [propose a change](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-design-system/edit/master/src/components/file-upload/index.md.njk) – read more about [how to propose changes in GitHub](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/community/propose-a-content-change-using-github/).

We're more likely to link to things that are relevant, well-maintained and consistent with the [GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/) and the [Service Standard](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard).

For example, we wouldn't link to a resource if:

- it's not relevant to our users
- it's not clear who owns it
- it's really out of date
- it's not easily reusable
- it's poorly documented and supported
- it's incompatible with government standards
- you have to pay for it in some way
