The contents of the Design System must be of a high quality and meet user needs. To guarantee this, all components and patterns need to meet certain criteria.

## Proposing a component or pattern

To be successful, proposals need to show that the component or pattern being suggested would be useful and unique.


{{ govukTable({
  caption: "New proposals criteria",
  captionClasses: "govuk-visually-hidden",
  firstCellIsHeader: true,
  classes: "app-table--constrained",
  head: [
    {
      text: "Criteria"
    },
    {
      text: "Description"
    }
  ],
  rows: [
    [
      {
        text: "Useful"
      },
      {
        html: "<p> There is evidence that this component or pattern would be useful for many teams or services.</p>
        <p class='govuk-!-margin-bottom-0'>Evidence could be screenshots or links to versions of it being used in different services.</p>"
      }
    ],
    [
      {
        text: "Unique"
      },
      {
        html: "<p> It does not replicate something already in the Design System. </p>
        <p class='govuk-!-margin-bottom-0'>If it’s intended to replace an existing component or pattern, there is evidence to show that it’s better than the existing version.</p>"
      }
    ]
  ]
}) }}


The [Design System working group](/community/design-system-working-group) reviews proposals in the [community backlog](/community/backlog) to check they meet these criteria. Proposals that meet the criteria will then be marked 'to do', ready to be worked on.

## Developing a component or pattern

Before a new component or pattern is published the working group reviews the implementation to make sure it is usable, consistent and versatile.

  firstCellIsHeader: true,

    {
      text: "Description"
    }
  ],
  rows: [
    [
      {
        text: "Usable"
      },
      {
        html: "<p>It has been tested  in user research and shown to work with a representative sample of users, including those with disabilities.</p>

        <p class='govuk-!-margin-bottom-0'>Components and patterns which are not proven usable can be published as experimental. But they must be clearly based on relevant user research from other organisations and best practice, and meet the other criteria.</p>"

      {
        text: "Consistent"
      },
      {
        html: "<p>It reuses existing styles and components in the Design System where relevant.</p>

    [
      {
        text: "Versatile"
      },
      {
        html: "<p>The implementation is versatile enough that the component or pattern can be used in a range of different services that may need it.</p>

        <p>For example, a versatile date input component could be set up to ask for a year only, a month and year only, a precise date, or any other combination you may need.</p>

        <p class='govuk-!-margin-bottom-0'>The component or pattern must also have been tested and shown to work with a range of <a href='https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/designing-for-different-browsers-and-devices'>browsers, assistive technologies and devices</a>.</p>"

## Developing a community resource

Before linking to a community resource the Design System team will review it to make sure it has an owner and is supported, up-to-date and consistent with the Design System and our standards.

  caption: "Before we link to a community resource",
  captionClasses: "govuk-visually-hidden",
  firstCellIsHeader: true,
  classes: "app-table--constrained",

    {
      text: "Criteria"
    },
    {
      text: "Description"
    }
  ],
  rows: [
    [
      {
        text: "Owned"
      },
      {
        text: "It’s clear who is responsible for the resource and who isn’t."
      }
    ],
    [
      {
        text: "Supported"
      },
      {
        text: "There is documentation explaining how to use, contribute to and get support for the resource. Support tickets are generally answered within a month."
      }
    ],
    [

        text: "Up-to-date"
      },
      {
        text: "Production resources are no more than 1 month behind the latest release of GOV.UK Frontend. Design resources no more than 3 months behind the latest release of the GOV.UK Design System."
      }
    ],
    [
      {
        text: "Consistent"
      },
      {
        text: "The resource is consistent with the styles, components and patterns in the GOV.UK Design System, and production resources output the same markup as GOV.UK Frontend."
      }
    ],
    [
      {
        text: "Compliant"
      },
      {
        html: "<p class='govuk-!-margin-bottom-0'>The resource isn't a barrier to meeting the <a href='https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard'>Service Standard</a> and the <a href='https://www.gov.uk/guidance/content-design/links'>GOV.UK external linking policy</a>.</p>
        
        <p>For example, it doesn't produce services that are inaccessible, insecure or hard to maintain, and linking to it would not give one commercial supplier an advantage over another.</p>"
